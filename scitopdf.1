.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBscitopdf\fP automatically downloads papers from Sci-Hub based on heterogeneous and potentially incomplete informations (title, URL, DOI, authors, year of publication...). Sci-Hub URL can be specified or automatically located thanks to \fIhttps://sci-hub.now.sh\fP. Calls to \fIhttps://crossref.org\fP API to pinpoint the right paper are made when provided information to identify a paper is incomplete.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-l\fP, \ \fB\-\-list \ \fB \fIbibliography_file\fP
Download multiple papers referenced in a bibliography file. The bibliography file is any text file. Each reference to a paper in the bibliography file \fBmust\fP be placed on its own single line. A reference to a paper can be any information (title, DOI, etc.).
.TP
.BI \-D\fP, \ \fB \-\-download\-dir\ \fB \fIdownload_dir_path\fP
Manually set the download directory.
.TP
.BI \-u\fP, \ \fB \-\-url\ \fB \fIURL\fP
Manually set Sci-Hub URL.
.TP
.BI \-p\fP, \ \fB \-\-no\-auto\-open
Skip automatic opening of downloaded papers.
.TP
.BI \-q\fP, \ \fB \-\-quiet
Silent mode. Nothing displayed on stdout.
.TP
.BI \-w\fP, \ \fB\-\-wait \ \fB \fIseconds\fP
Set the delay between two requests (in seconds). Accepts integers and decimals (e.g. "0.3" or "10"). Effective only when used in conjunction with \fB--list\fP.
.TP
.BI \-b\fP, \ \fB\-\-break-after \ \fB \fInb_requests\fP
Make a break every chosen number of requests (integers only). Effective only when used in conjunction with \fB--list\fP. If \fB--break-for\fP is not set, default break duration value is 15 seconds.
.TP
.BI \-d\fP, \ \fB\-\-break-for \ \fB \fIseconds\fP
Set the break duration (in seconds). Accepts integers and decimals (e.g. "0.3" or "10"). Effective only when used in conjunction with \fB--list\fP and \fB--break-after\fP.
.TP
.BI \-\-dns \ \fB \fIip1,ip2,...\fP
Experimental. Tries using \fBcurl\fP's \fI--dns-servers\fP option to bypass current DNS settings. But this needs \fBlibcurl\fP to be compiled with \fBc-ares\fP support. If not the case, uses \fBcurl\fP's \fI--resolve\fP option which has a much lower chance of success. DNS must be provided as a comma-separated list of IPs.
.TP
.BI \-\-ref
Display and copy to clipboard paper's BibTex reference.
.TP
.BI \-\-dmenu
Use dmenu as prompt. Support for other menus will come.

.BI \-h\fP, \ \fB \-\-help

1 \ Error with the URL.

2 \ DOI cannot be found.

3 \ Paper filename is empty.
